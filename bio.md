##Programming Background
*My experience in programming, in my opinion, is limited. 
I've had the most exposure to the C++ language with my favorite 
project to date being an implementation of Conway's Game of Life. 
Aside from C++, I have dabbled some on websites like Codeacademy
and Coursera in HTML and Python primarily. 

*In addition to my background that is directly related to
programming, I have done approximately two years of quality
assurance work in a professional setting. This has mostly been
in a black box setting, however on occassion I have had the 
opportunity to get my hands dirty reviewing/editing existing
code bases.

##Rewriting the future
*To get here I had to rewrite the past. I had to undo deleting the
programming-bio branch which was actually fairly simple. Using 
stackoverflow I was able to use the git command reflog and then find
where the branch programming-bio was and use git checkout -b programming-bio [sha]
to recreate the branch I had deleted after the merge. Git is cool!
