##Programming Background
My experience in programming, in my opinion, is limited. 
I've had the most exposure to the C++ language with my favorite 
project to date being an implementation of Conway's Game of Life. 
Aside from C++, I have dabbled some on websites like Codeacademy
and Coursera in HTML and Python primarily.
